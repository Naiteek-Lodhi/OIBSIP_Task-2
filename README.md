# Number Guessing Game GUI

This is a Java Swing-based Number Guessing Game GUI application. The game generates a random number within a specified range (default range is 1 to 100) and allows the player to guess the number within a limited number of attempts (default is 5 attempts). The player can enter their guess in the provided text field and click the "Guess" button or press Enter to submit their guess.

2. The game will generate a random number within the specified range (1 to N) and display it in the GUI.

4. Click the "Guess" button or press Enter to submit your guess.
5. The application will provide feedback on your guess (higher or lower) and display the number of attempts made.
6. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number or exceed the maximum attempts allowed.
